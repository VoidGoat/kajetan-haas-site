		<p>Why is a guy with one blog post telling you to make a blog? While I definitely don't know what I'm talking about, I do want to see your blog and I bet you'd enjoy starting one.</p>
<p>I am on a quest to find fun stuff to do, and luckily it's looking like there's a lot of good options. <mark>Add a transition or overall cohesion here</mark></p>
<p>The internet is a pretty nifty tool and enables lots of fun stuff, but it's become clear that our excitable monkey brains are no match for the finely tuned persuasive algorithms of mega corporations, which would be fine if we liked the results, but I'm not sure we do.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To seek satisfaction in a world overwhelmed with excitement, I think we benefit from lowering our tolerance for perfection. Some of the most profound, compelling, beautiful, and enjoyable experiences can be conveyed simply and imperfectly. Huge teams, lots of money, and honed craft can do impressive things but they're not required for creating something worthwhile, and many activities benefit from simplicity.</p>
<p>How do we bring more of that into life? Things tend to keep getting bigger, greater, and more complicated, so we get accustomed to that. The only way to change that is to pursue simple activities. While a blog served on the internet is not a simple thing, it is simpler, slower, and more enjoyable than many alternative ways to explore and convey an idea.</p>
<p><h1>I. What are you talking about?</h1>I think in the coming years we will start to seek ways to communicate and express ourselves that are less entangled with the motives of large companies and are more personalized, more fulfilling, and smaller in scope. I find myself not getting much long term satisfaction from the large content-serving platforms and I don't get excited about contributing to them or consuming from them. I don't want to harp on why our current popular methods of communication and expression are falling short, there's plenty of people talking about that, I'd rather consider what alternatives exist that are potentially more satisfying. Over time, new tools will emerge to help us connect and create but if simplicity is a goal then the old tools may offer just as much value. The blog, newsletter, magazine, and hand written letter all offer a lot of good qualities,</p>
<p>they are:</p>
<p><ul><li>Non-urgent - they do not demand your attention, but offer something valuable when you have attention to spare. Whether you look at them today or in a year, they will be the same and still have value.</li><li>Self contained - Context is important and these tools either present themselves among related content or as singular works.</li><li>Expressive - They can be whatever you want them to be, you decide what is worthwhile.</li><li>Simplicity</li></ul>The initial downside is that they are not necessarily immediately stimulating and engaging. However, to me it seems more appealing to do something less stimulating that you actually enjoy, rather than the alternative.</p>
<p>Flexibility can also be daunting but if you create some constraints of your own devising, you can do some fun stuff you wouldn't explore when following the constraints of existing platforms. You can have a blog or newsletter where you send out a weekly two sentence joke, or write a 10000 word deep dive into a topic that fascinates you. Maybe the classic blog structure doesn't appeal you you. It's your website, you can make it do whatever you want. Add abstract gifs, make a collage of collected images, make a single page website where you continuously add to a 10000 word tome. You can do it all. Or not. <mark>This whole section could be straightened up</mark></p>
<p></p>
<p>But mostly, it's fun! You are probably busy in a thousand ways, but it is enjoyable to slow down and make something just because you want to. I see no benefit to making this post other than I'm enjoying doing it. There's no analytics on this site so I couldn't tell if anyone is reading this if I wanted to. There's also no ads ðŸ¤¢. And while I've seen some lively, intriguing comment sections, I've seen more of the opposite. Since they don't let you write your grievances underneath the paintings at the art museum, I'm not letting you do it here. If you have any thoughts you want to share about this post, feel free to send me some electronic or physical mail. It'd be great to hear from you!</p>
<p></p>
<p>While I'll probably do whatever I want, my general goal for this blog is to:</p>
<p>a) have fun making it</p>
<p>b) write about some tiny projects that I wouldn't normally talk about or would have posted on social media otherwise.</p>
<p>I might post some photography, programming projects, art, try wacky web design or just write down a random thought. I am interested in tools we can use to connect and create that actually make us feel good about doing those hallowed things, hopefully I'll continue to explore that space too. <mark>If you have any ideas in that realm, let me know</mark></p>
<p><h2>II. What's the point?</h2>We humans are facing a lot of big problems, big ol' chunky existential threats at various scales. But I think an under-appreciated problem is the threat to joy, fun, and satisfaction. We love to speak practically, but what is the practical purpose of billions of humans? We exist, at least in part, in service to our collective experience of life. The practical problems are solved to enrich our experience, they serve no purpose on their own. We are excellent at advancing technology but little advancement has been made to ignite humanity's passion for existence. We are passionate beings but we are also easily beaten down and confused. A blog is as good a place as any to starting talking about what is essential and inspiring to you.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Mostly, I'm recommending you make some things that you find fun or satisfying and maybe do that instead of activities that end up making your brain feel like mush.</p>
<p>ðŸš¨Controversial opinion alertðŸš¨.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Some of my favorite things on the internet are blogs from random people sharing their thoughts, with archives going back over a decade. Since I am a nerd, most of my favs are from programmers talking about technical ideas and sharing little projects. There are all kinds of people still sharing their little ideas on blogs though. Here are some of my favorites, a mix of technical, art, and personal blogs:</p>
<p><ul><li>Angelo Pesce's <a href="https://c0de517e.com/index.htm">c0de517e</a> - sometimes philosophical posts on graphics and technology</li><li><a href="https://www.volpinprops.com/blog/">Volpin Props</a> - Building crazy good-looking props. My fav <a href="https://www.volpinprops.com/portal-gun/">post</a></li></ul>The most popular modern blogs are typically very commercial and focus exclusively on a niche topic. They are peppered with ads and affiliate links.</p>
<p>That's fine but is not what I'm suggesting. The interestingness of an idea is inversely proportional to the size of the intended audience. If your audience is a million people you will tackle more broad and bland topics than if your audience is 3 friends, or just yourself. Your blog doesn't need to be <em>about</em> anything and it doesn't need to be productive, it can just be a place to put any random stuff you like. <mark>Is this necessary</mark></p>
<p></p>
<p>Also, blog is apparently short for weblog, which is not how abbreviations should work. Please direct all  disgruntledness towards <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog#History">Peter Merholz</a> and his <a href="https://www.peterme.com/">ongoing, very old blog</a>.</p>

<p><h1>III. How to do blog</h1>If you have any inkling to revel in the joy of blog, here are my recommendations. There are nearly a bajillion ways to host a website on the internet, if you already have a way you like to do it, use that. Otherwise, here are some of the simplest, most enjoyable, and most free ways I've found to get started:</p>
<p><ul><li>Github Pages - This is what I'm using and is a great blend of flexibility and simplicity. It will host any static webpages you make and can also be configured to generate blog posts from simple markdown text files. However, it is more complex to set up and better for the technologically adept or technologically curious. Here is a short guide to set it up that requires no programming: <a href="https://chadbaldwin.net/2021/03/14/how-to-build-a-sql-blog.html">How to</a></li><li>Substack - Seems like the simplest way to get started quickly if you just want to start hammering out words and pictures to share online. It's a little too platformy for my taste and really focuses on getting writers paid and building their audience, which I guess is cool but not really the point.</li><li>Many other easy options like Blogger, Medium, or Google Sites, maybe some of those are good. If you want to pay for something simple and reliable, Posthaven seems good.</li></ul>You can get a domain name, like the cool kajetan.org, wherever domain names are sold, you don't need one to get started though.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you run into any technical or motivational issues getting started, I'm happy to help.</p>
<p>If you make a blog, have already made one, or know about fun ones, let me know!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Anyway, that's enough chatter. Make a blog, start a newsletter, send someone a letter, call your parent or parent equivalent, etc. etc.</p>
<p>Mkay bye, have fun.</p>
